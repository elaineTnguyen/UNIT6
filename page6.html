    <h1> Unit 7 - Using and Analyzing Data & Information </h1>

    <h2>7.2 - Big Data</h2>

    <h3>1) Choose one of the data sets listed above in the Activity section or one that you find on your own and give a brief description of it. What specifically were the types of data (text, sounds, transactions, etc.) included in the data set you chose?</h3>


    <a href="https://ibb.co/t85H8fQ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/kQFGQn5/FPLCT-copy-1.jpg" width= 500></a>

    <h4>This data set includes information that displays the percentage of various crops that make up the acre. They’re placed side by side comparing which crop takes up more land. This data includes visual text data.</h4>

   <h3>2) What new facts did you learn when exploring the data set? List at least 3 facts.</h3>

   <h4>New facts I’ve learned after viewing the data includes the average percentage of the crops on the land. Over 15% of the land consists of almonds, the price of almonds vary depending on Ibs however spikes around a certain amount of Ibs.</h4>

   <h3>3) Write a question you have about the data set you chose. Now, convert that question into a hypothesis (a statement) with your prediction about the data.</h3>

   <h4>What year were the almonds priced at $3.50? The year the almonds were priced at $3.50 was 2014.</h4>

   <h3>4) Identify at least one security and/or privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set you chose?</h3>

   <h4>Privacy might be concerning if people were trying to hide the inclination of prices on various agriculture.</h4>

   <h3>5) If your data set included a visualization, explain the purpose of the visualization. How would you change or improve the visualization? If it did not include a visualization, describe one that you think would be useful in understanding the data.</h3>

   <h4>The purpose of the visualization is to compare the amount of growth of each crop.</h4>

   <h2>7.3 - Visualizing Data</h2>

   <h3>1) (Activity 2) Write a spreadsheet formula that calculates the average elevation for the data in this spreadsheet. Write your formula and the result found in your portfolio.</h3>

   <h4>=Average(rows of data) which in the data would look like =average(J2-J88) and the average would equal to 280. </h4>

   <h3>2) (Activity 2) Are there more male or female butterflies in this data set? Include a screenshot of your chart to answer this question. What kind of data is in your chart?</h3>

   <h2>7.4 - Data Visualization Project </h2>

   <h3>1) Which data set did you select and why did you choose it?</h3>

   <h4>We chose the data set that included NCHS Drug Poisoning Mortality by State United States</h4>

   <h3>2) Summarize the data included, being specific about the types of data (text, sounds, transactions, etc.) included. Make sure you list the title and the website (URL) where you found the data.</h3>

   <h4>The data specifies the year, sex, age group in each state that has died from drug poisoning. The data was found on the data.gov dataset catalog. </h4>

   <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nchs-drug-poisoning-mortality-by-county-united-states-24142">click for data set</a>

   <h3>3) List your 3-5 hypotheses and the data visualizations that you created for each. (Include the visualizations as images on your portfolio or provide a link to them shared with your instructor.)</h3>

   <h4>Hypoythesis Qs:      
    1. Which sex is mostly drug poisoned during the year of 2017?       
    Males are mostly effected from the results of drug poisoning.</h4>

    <h3>5) Identify at least one security and/or privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set you chose.</h3>

    <h4>A security concern might be that some people might use this data to their advantage and scope a state that might have more occurances to cause less suspicion.</h4>

    <h2>7.5 - Data Map App </h2>

    <h3>1) How and why are files used as a data abstraction in this app?</h3>

    <h4>Files are used as a data abstraction in this app because the file block condenses all the information from the file into a single call file block.</h4>

    <h3>2) Explain the List of Lists data abstraction used in this app.</h3>

    <h4>The lists data abstraction used in the data map app is used to select out of another list. Example; selecting out of the list of states to provide a list of information for one state.</h4>

    <h3>3) When and why do programmers use APIs?</h3>

    <h4>Programmers use APIs to create whatever they need to create. Example; Programmers use programs like sublime to code games or websites.</h4>

    <h3>4) Provide screenshots of your enhancement projects. (At least ONE and TWO)</h3>

    <a href="https://ibb.co/NF1fj6h"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qD0hsMG/Screen-Shot-2020-03-12-at-11-32-54-PM.png" width=550 ></a>

    <h2>7.7 - Machine Learning and Arificial Intelligence </h2>

    <h3>1) In the Teachable Machine activity, what inputs were easy for the program to learn to distinguish and what inputs were more difficult?</h3>

    <h4>The easier inputs the program understood includes a hand moving up or down and the input that the machine found more difficult includes unusual face expressions.</h4>

    <h3>2) Search online and identify another application area for AI or machine learning besides the ones described in this lesson. Is this task hard easy for humans but hard for computers to do?</h>

    <h4>Applications that involve AI include video games that use real life movements and replicate it in gameplay. This task is easy to do because our brains are taught this at a young age, and it is more intricate, we are able to understand emotions.</h4>

    <h3>3) In this lesson you saw some examples of gender bias in a machine translation program. Identify another form of unconscious bias and give an example of how it could affect a computer program. Explain how that could be a harmful effect on society, economy, or culture.</h3>

    <h4> Another way machine translation can be caused by bias is when their owners opinions are reflected in the machines output. This can be harmful to our society because technology is growing in popular and bias opinions can shift the nature of society. </h4>

    <h2>7.8 - Impacts of CS (Who owns the bits?) </h2>

    <h3>1) In your own words, define the concept of copyright. Why should all Internet users be aware of copyrighted material?</h3>

    <h4>Copyright is when you claim a certain phrase, invention, idea, etc. All Internet users should be aware of copyrighted material because material can be easily copied and claimed as their own and once they copyright it, by law they then own it.</h4>

    <h3>2) What is the difference between digital and printed documents that makes it easier to violate copyright law with digital ones?</h3>

    <h4>Printed documents can be kept by the owner and would be harder to obtain or violate. Rather, digital documents are easier to violate because their are loop holes and no one is mainly responsible. </h4>

    <h3>3) What is a peer-to-peer architecture? Provide an example of at least one well-known peer-to-peer network.</h3>

    <h4>Peer to Peer architecture is used for file sharing, a client will ask for something and each server would have a little segment of it then condense it into something more.</h4> 

    <h3>4) What is the DMCA and why is it significant to copyright, especially with regards to electronic works (documents, images, videos, etc.)?</h3>
    
    <h4>DMCA is a rule to try and regulate the issue with copyright by issuing a law making it a crime to illegally copy or code crack.</h4>

    <h3>5) What are Open Access and Creative Commons? How have they impacted the sharing of digital information?</h3>

    <h4>Open access allows user to use materials like journals or books without having to pay a fee, creative commons also allows users to share or use contents of the original without any copyright claims.</h4>

    <h3>6) The Blown to Bits book is released under a Creative Commons (CC) license, specifically the Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license. What does this license allow people other than the authors to do? What is the relationship between the original Blown to Bits book and the newer, Blown to Bits (version 2.0) book? Did the authors of the newer version stay true to the CC license? How can you tell? (Optional) If your favorite book or movie was released with a CC license, how would you change it?</h3>

    <h4>This license allows users to share, edit and redistribute in any way. The relationship between the riginal Blown to Bits book and the newer, Blown to Bits (version 2.0) book is standard, the original gets credited and even stays true to the original. IF my favorite movie were to be realeased with a CC license I would be excited, but at the same time, have high standards.</h4>

    <h3>7) The chapter describes three peer-to-peer networks, each of which can be used to share copyrighted works illegally. Why did the courts find that Napster and Grokster were liable for the illegal activities of it's users, while BitTorrent is not?</h3>

    <h4>Napster and Grokster were liable for the illegal activities of it's users because they knew that their users were distributing copyright material and that they were doing so on their servers. While BitTorrent did not face any charges because their code did not allow seperate severs and hosts. </h4>
    
    <h3>8) What effect have streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify had on illegal downloading activities?</h3>

    <h4>Netflix and Spotify has had a positive effect on the whole copyright issue. This is due to them allowing users to pay a small fee to view or listen to legally obtained content, rather then tediously illegally downloading files.</h4>

    <h3>9) Why was it important for Jack Andraka to have access to research articles? In general, how has access to information helped to identify problems, develop solutions, and disseminate results?</h3>

    <h4>It was important for Jack Andraka to have access to research articles because it created the fortunate cure for pancreatic cancer. Everyone being able to access research from different researchers can be a huge benefit to the world. The easy access and efficient way to do research can stimulate various discoveries. </h4>

    <h3>10) What is your responsibility as an app developer in regards to the fair use of copyrighted works such as images and music? Give one example use of a copyrighted work in an app that follows fair use guidelines and one example that violates fair use guidelines.</h3>

    <h4>Our responsibility as an app developer in regards to the fair use of copyrighted works is to always give credit to the original creators. An example is popular mini sound clips used in videos, usually are given credit. However, if any original copyrighted content is used wothout being credited cna result in charges. </h4>

    <h3>11) In your opinion, are YouTube users violating copyright terms when they make lyric videos? Why or why not?</h3>

    <h4>In my opinion YouTube using lyrics from existign music violates the copyright terms because the audio is still the creators original, as long as credit is clearly given I think it's only fair.  </h4>
