    <h1> Unit 5 - Algorithms and Procedural Abstraction </h1>

    <h2>5.2 - Logo, Part 2 </h2>

    <h3>1) Include a screenshot of an interesting design that your Logo app made AND a screenshot of the code that created it.  </h3>

    <a href="https://ibb.co/zskC0B6"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/y03KbZ4/IMG-2180.jpg" width= "350"></a>

    <h3>2) Describe in your own words, with a specific example from Logo, how our choice of abstractions (commands) in this lesson provides us with the ability to solve problems that couldn't be solved with the abstractions (commands) used in Logo Part 1.</h3>

    <h4>In Logo part 2 we are able to use parameters enable to add more functions. For example in the shape we made above we included commands that allowed the character to turn at different angles and make unique shapes. Compared to Logo part 1 where we were only able to rotate 90 degrees; only allowing us to make squares and rectangles.  </h4>

    <h2>5.3 - Search Algorithms </h2>

    <h3>1) (POGIL) Define a pseudocode algorithm that will efficiently play the guessing game.</h3>

    <h4>A pseudocode algorithm that would efficiently play the guessing game would try to target a specific target (most likely number). This is done by guessing a random number; if the number is either lower or higher certain commands are triggered. An example is if the target is higher the rest of the numbers would be deleted and you would come closer to the target. That is then repeated until the target is finally found.</h4>

    <h3>2) (POGIL) To guess a number between 1 and 100, what's the maximum number of guesses your algorithm would take?</h3>

    <h4>The number of guesses would be 7 because if you use the binary search method it would result in 2^7 which equals to 128 which is the closest to 100. </h4>

    <h3>3) (POGIL) To guess a number between 1 and 500, what's the maximum number of guesses your algorithm would take?</h3>

    <h4>The maximum number of guesses would be 9 because 2^9 is equal to 512 which is over 500 and is the closest compared to other numbers of guesses.</h4>

    <h3>4) Suppose you have a deck of cards and you want to find the Ace of Spades. If the deck is shuffled, which is the best search algorithm to use and why?</h3>

    <h4>If the deck was shuffled and our task was to find the ace of spades the best method would be the linear search because the cards are not in order to be able to do the binary search.</h4>

    <h3>5) Give an example of a search problem you encounter in everyday life. Does it use sequential, binary, or some other search algorithm?</h3>

    <h4> An example of a search problem I encounter everyday is guessing the time my mom will come home. I have an already estimated time of what time she might come home because of previous times. The time is around 7 however factors might contribute to her coming home a little early or late. She usually lets us know if shes leaving early or later. So in some ways the search is binary because you're guessing between a timeframe of either 6:30 to 7 or 7 to 7:30. However it is most likely a sequential search because I don't constantly annoy my mom for every minute she's coming home. </h4>

    <h2>5.4 - Sorting Algorithms </h2>

    <h3>1) Bubble and Merge Sort are referred to as comparison sorts because the values of the two pieces of data are compared during each step. Why are the radix and bucket sort not comparison sorts?</h3>

    <h4>The radix and the bucket sort is not a comparing sort because you are not comparing two indivdual cards but instead you're either sorting based on a specific characteristic or by each integer.</h4>

    <h3>2) Which sort do you think would be the fastest if you had to sort more than one deck of cards? Why?</h3>

    <h4>The fastest sorting method to sort more than one deck of cards would be the bucket sort because the amount of cards; you can sort by the the cards faces then the values. </h4>

    <h2>5.5 - Quiz App</h2>

    <h3>1) Describe the significance of the global variable index. How is indexing used with lists in this app?</h3>

    <h4>The global variable index has an important role because it allows lists to store different items as well as locate where a certain item is. 

    <h3>2) Describe how parallel lists were used in this app. Why was the parallel structure of the lists necessary?</h3>

    <h4>Parallel lists are multiple lists that correspond with eachother. The parallel structure is required to match items; an example is a list of question in order to match the answer. </h4>

    <h3>3) Include screenshots of your code for exercises 2 and 3 from the Enhancements section.</h3>

    <a href="https://ibb.co/fDbbrZ2"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/dmSSkXr/Screen-Shot-2020-01-28-at-10-06-18-PM.png" width= "700" ></a>

    <a href="https://ibb.co/9cb3jmk"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/djPJysw/Screen-Shot-2020-01-28-at-10-15-36-PM.png" width= "700"></a>


    <h3>4) Include a screenshot of the code that added your extra question (exercise 4) AND explain why the code for the buttons worked without any changes after the addition of the extra question.</h3>

    <a href="https://ibb.co/qsLnVXg"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vPCBRgd/Screen-Shot-2020-01-28-at-10-27-38-PM.png" width= "500" ></a>

    <h4>We were only required to add more questions to the parallel lists and not add or alter anything else on the list disregarding the random interger selection because the image/question/correct label would select an item from the list using the index. </h4>

    <h2>5.6 - Quiz App Projects </h2>

    <h3> 1) Describe your solution for the second project that added a Search button. Provide a SCREENSHOT of the search button click code that uses a complex algorithm with loops and lists. Why was a loop necessary?</h3>

    <a href="https://ibb.co/cQ6TSHC"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pdfXB8R/Screen-Shot-2020-01-28-at-10-06-33-PM.png" width= "1000"></a>

    <h4>The second project included a search bar which consisted of a loop that will go on infinitely without stopping. The words typed in the search bar are then made to be uppercase to select from either the question or answer. And if the keywords correspond to what was typed the picture/question/correct label will appear.   </h4>

    <h3>2) Write AP text-style pseudocode for a linear search that searches through a list to find an item x. It should display found if the x is equal to an item in the list.</h3>

    <h4>list <-- 1,0,4,2</h4>
    <h4>x <- -1</h4>
    <h4>for each item in list</h4>
    <h4>if item > x</h4>
    <h4>x <- item</h4>
    <h4>display x <h4>

    <h3>3) Give brief descriptions of the enhancements you added to your app for the third project, a quiz topic of your own choosing. Provide SCREENSHOTS of important blocks and describe how you used them to solve certain programming problems.</h3>

    <a href="https://ibb.co/88LqrWz"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/C03gbkJ/Screen-Shot-2020-01-29-at-12-29-45-AM.png" ></a>

    <h4>One of the enhancements we included was the AccelerometerSensor which would call the Roll procedure, this procedure included two procedures within it. These two procedures would call a random question and set the image/question/correct to the corresponding question chosen from the list. </h4>

    <h3>4) To practice for the Create project prompt, grab a SCREENSHOT of a program code segment from your project that implements an algorithm that includes two or more algorithms within it and includes mathematical and/or logical concepts. An ideal algorithm is a procedure that you created that includes calls to other procedures that you created, where at least one of those includes math or logic (ifs or loops). Describe how each of the two algorithms within the bigger algorithm functions independently as well as in combination to form a new algorithm.  Basically, answer 2c!</h3>

    <h4>Our app includes a search bar algorithm which is significant to our app because it allows users to search for keywords that will then display the corresponding question and image. The search bar algorithm consists of multiple algorithms within such as the logical blocks. The logical blocks display the algorithm where the texts would be upcase whether the keyword matches with the question or answer. The next algorithm is then triggered by the logic block and results in the set procedure to set image1, question label, and correct label to the corresponding item on the list. These algorithms work together to make the search bar functional. When the search bar is clicked the if then statement containing the logic block and procedure block work together and result in a successful search. </h4>

    <h2>5.7 - Analyzing Algorithms </h2>

    <h3>1) Present the results and the analysis you did for each of the experiments in this lesson, -- i.e., the table of running times you observed, the graphs you created, and the conclusions you reached regarding the searching algorithms and sorting algorithms. Provide a clear description, referring to your graphs and your tabulated data (which are included, or linked to), to explain how you arrived at your conclusions.</h3>

    <h4>After inputing the information obtained from running the different algorthims the graphs displayed two lines that were significantly different. The binary Search resulted in straight lines that and consistently staying at the same sorting time. While the Binary search would slowly increase the time to search. The Bucket sort, Bubble sort,and Merge sort also showed a difference. The bubble sort was the slowest compared to the other two sorting methods as the time slowly escalated. The merge sort and bucket sort is fairly the same according the graph, the sorting time barely changes as searches go on.  </h4>

    <h2>5.8 - Limits of Algorithms </h2>

    <h3>1) (POGIL) A password scheme consists of a minimum password length and the different types of symbols (i.e., letters, numbers, specials) that can be used in the password. Using the Password Strength Calculator, determine the optimal scheme for withstanding a brute force attack of at least 10 years by an ordinary PC performing 100 million tests per second.</h3>

    <h4>The optimal scheme for withstanding a brute force attack of at least 9 characters with the use of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters included in the password. This scheme is able to withstand 12.8 years of attack.</h4>

    <h3>2)  (POGIL) According to this 2012 article, a password-cracking computer can try 350 billion passwords per second. How would you have to modify your scheme to withstand a 10-year attack by this specially designed computer?</h3>

    <h4>The optimal scheme for withstanding a force attack of at least 10-year attack with 350 billion passwords per second would be a password length of 11 that has lower cases, numbers, and special characters but with no upper cases. </h4>

    <h3>3) (POGIL) That article was written in 2012. Password cracking technology has probably gotten a lot better. Suppose the number of passwords that can be checked per second doubles every year, use the Password Strength Calculator to determine an optimal password scheme for the year 2020?</h3>

    <h4>If the number of passwords checked doubled each year from 2012 to 2020 the total amount of passwords checked would be roughly 80 trillion. The optimal password scheme for the year 2020 would have the password length of 11, contain uppercase, lower case, numbers, and special characters, would result in 25.3 years to crack. </h4>

    <h3>4) (POGIL) For the routes starting and ending at Trinity College, identify the nearest neighbor route and the optimal route. What does this show you about the nearest neighbor heuristic?</h3>

    <h4>The nearest routes had 8.2 miles while the optimal had 7.6. For the time consumed to find a better route of of only .6 miles, the nearest route is sometimes effective to use. </h4>

    <h2>5.9 - Impacts of CS: Web Searches</h2>

    <h3>1) How do web search tools make it more efficient to find information?</h3>

    <h4>Web search tools make it more efficient to find information because the tools are constantly developing and storing information to build a stronger index.</h4>

    <h3>2) When you type a word or phrase into the Google search engine, what is the search algorithm that is being used?  Explain in your own words the process used by Google's search engine.</h3>

    <h4>The search algorithm that Google's search engine uses is the page rank. The process google uses to search is based on keywords. </h4>

    <h3>3) What is a captcha? How has the collective efforts of Internet users contributed to analyzing images through captchas?</h3>

    <h4>Captcha is a test testing whether the user is a human or not. Overtime captchas has allowed users to also question other people and for their benefit. </h4>

    <h3>4) "The architecture of human knowledge has changed as a result of search." Do you agree? Explain your reasoning. </h3>

    <h4>I strongly agree because the abilty to search has provided the human brain to study broadly within a short amount of time and possibly in one sitting. However, searches could also result in false information learned.</h4>

    <h3>5) What are the differences between Figures 4.10 and Figure 4.11 in the book? Why are there differences even though they are both a Google search results page?</h3>

    <h4>In 4.10 the book goes through the search results to Falun Gong. However in 4.11 when Falun Gong is searched up most of the information was not found compared to the searches in US. This is the result of China censoring certain things, enable to try and conceal it.  </h4>

    <h3>6) How do you think mobile computing might have influenced web searches? Would you retain your search history or delete it? Why?</h3>

    <h4>Mobile computing has definitely influenced web searches to become more effiecient due to the mobility of the device. I would retain my search history because it's an interesting concept to look back at previous searches.</h4>

    <h3>7) Would you retain your search history or delete it? Why?</h3>

    <h4>I would retain my search history because it's an interesting concept to look back at previous searches.</h4>

    <h3>8) Should a researcher place absolute trust in a search engine? Why or why not?</h3>

    <h4>A researcher should not only rely on a search engine because information can be published from anyone and is not always reliable. </h4>

    <h3>9) The authors claim "search is a new form of control over information" (p. 111) and "search is power" (p. 145). Why might it be important to talk about the social implications of searching on the Internet?</h3>

    <h4>It is important to talk about the social implications of searching on the internet because many people nowadays especially the younger generation are using the internet to do research. However the information is not always accurate and false rumors can be spread.</h4>

    <h3>10) How have search trends been used to predict information? What are the positive and negative impacts of using trends to make predictions?</h3>

    <h4>Search trends have been used to predict information which is then inputted on the top of the suggestion list. The positive of this is that people can keep track of relevant news. A negative might be following a trend for the wrong reason.</h4>

    <h3>11) Find and read an article about web searches or algorithms. Write a 3-4 paragraph summary of the article. Include the author's name, the title of the article, the date it was published, and a link to the article.</h3>

    <h4>In How Search Engine Algorithms Work: Everything You Need to Know written by Dave Davies; he discusses the basics of how search algortihms work. In the beginning of the article he includes a brief summary of what algorithms are. He also includes how search algorithms use entities and the purpose of using entities. And finally, he answers how search algorithms work.
    </h4>
    <h4>
        The author describes an algorithm as a recipe. He compares it to people liking certain types of foods and creating a formula to satisfy each person. The purpose of a algorithm is to determine how their used enable to produce the final product. There's a certain algorithm that controls the whole algorithm enable to function. An entity is “A thing or concept that is singular, unique, well-defined and distinguishable.” Google functions using entities, by labeling everything using entities and simplifying the process google can easily judge the websites at large.
    </h4>
    <h4>
            So, how do search algorithms work? Search algorithms consists of a huge collection of varying algorithms and formulas, which is also connected to entities who relate to eachother in order to provide relevancy. Really, algorithms are placed to monitor results from google searches and is apart of the ranking pages system. All for the satisfaction of users.
